## General Objective
  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin     cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort     needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- After Over coming Class Imbalance Trainning accuracy of 93 and validation accuracy of 75 was achived.
- The class imbalancing was solved by using image augmentation method. the model become best.
- we can improve further by working on the model hyperparameters
